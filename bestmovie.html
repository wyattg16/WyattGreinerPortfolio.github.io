<p>Kingsman is my favorite movie because it combines action and class. Every scene has its own secrets and exciting adventures. The movie also has lots of 'new' fighting technology for example an umbrella that turns into a screen and a riot shield.</p>
<p>My favorite actor in the movie is the one who I can most relate to which is Eggsy played by Taron Egerton. He is a teenager facing home troubles and falls into the hands of a secret agent and then becomes one. He plays this role very well, and I think his british accent helps.</p>
