						<h3>About Me</h3>
							<h5>Sports</h5>
								<p>I consider my sport to be gymnastics becasue I competed for 10 years, and I got all the way up to level 8 before I quit: or as I like to 
								call it retiring. The reason I quit is because I had a back injury that prohibited me from doing most of the events that I competed on. My 
								last goal was to make it to state, which I did, and then I would put down my grips and leave. Happily I still am involved with the gymnstics
								center because I work there as a coach for recreation kids. The sport that I do now sort of is equistrian vaulting which is basically gymnastics
								on a moving horse, I know it sounds crazy but if you look to the right you can see a picture of me doing a handstand on the horse. It is a really
								unique sport and I love doing it.
								</p>
							<h5>Work</h5>
								<p>My current job is a gymnastics coach for kids at the gym where I competed. I work fridays and teach different kids how to do simple
								things like forward rolls and hand stands. I enjoy my job because I can sometimes see myself in the little kids; also I like being back in
								the gymnastics center.
								</p>
							<h5>Hobbies</h5>
								<P>I would consider one of my hobbies to be equistrian vaulting as states above. I also enjoy taking pictures with my camera and am thnking about 
								starting up a photography business. I am showcasing some of my photos to the right so you can take a look there. I also like to drone, I currently
								have a DJI Phantom 3 standerd quadcopter, it can take really cool photos and videos from a perspective that you don't normally see in day to day life.
								Another thing that I like to do with my friends is to go paintballing, I own my own paintball gun and it is fun to go and play tournament games.
								</P>
