						<h3>Jeroo Content</h3>
						<h4>Unit 1</h4>
							<h5>Plant a Diamond</h5>
							<p>In this activity we had to use our Jeroo to go around the area and plant these 'flowers' in a diamond shape. We used code that repeated the same steps so it would create this shape easily. Another tricky task was not to fall in the water that surrounds the island.</p>

							<h5>Fenced In</h5>
							<p>In the fenced in activity we had to move our Jeroo down in a stair pattern and at the end of the stairs we had to use a flower that we picked up and throw it at the net so we could escape.

						<h4>Unit 2</h4>
							<h5>LED Lab</h5>
							<p>In this lab we had to use our Jeroo to create a number and once we had the code to make that number all we had to do is go to the top again with the same Jeroo except we would move the Jeroo 2 spaces over to create a gap and then we would copy and paste the same code to create the same number.</p>

							<h5>Escape Lab</h5>
							<p>This is one of the more difficult labs because we had to create a complex code that went up and down 'stairs', but the amount of hopping we had to do shortened every time. Luckly the same code worked for every Jeroo so all you had to do is code one of them and then apply it to the other Jeroos.</p>

						<h4>Unit 3</h4>
							<h5>Water Lab</h5>
							<p> In this lab we had to create a repeating, or looping, code that when it detected a water nearby then it would run a set code that would place flowers around the water.</p>

							<h5>Pinball Journey</h5>
							<p> In this journey we had to create a program that when through each line of the 'island' and when it ran into a flower it would pick it up. This would clean the enitre island so that it will be clear of flowers</p>
