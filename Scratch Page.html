		<p style="font-size:25">Description: I put a background of a person doing gymnastics. Then I had my name come in as different letters and they moved around the screen. The letters also changed colors as they moved around the screen. I also had a forever loop running a drum going back and forth across the bottom of the screen. Our rubic stated that we had to have 3 unique behaviours for each letter and that goal was accomplished in this project.</p>

		<p style="font-size:25">Description: My partner and I worked on researching 4 computers to present to the class based on a set of questions we gathered on our friends/family. After researching our computers we made a presentation in scratch. We loaded two scratch people and then they presented the computer research for us. At the end they tell the class which computer we choose and why.</p>

	<h3>Final Project (Game)</h3>
		<img src="C:\Users\greinerw5131\Desktop\GitHub\WyattGreinerPortfolio.github.io\Images\maze game screenshot.png" width="400" height="300"/>
		<p>Description: In this project we had to create a game where we had a start page, a question page and an actual game. In this project I decided to create a maze with multiple levels. You would guide your sprite throughout the maze using the arrow keys. If he hit one of the walls then he would bounce off the walls, not allowing the person to cheat. I also had a timer so if the person playing took too long then the game would end.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How to make a sprite not touch walls</li>
			<li>How to draw in a background</li>
			<li>How to add a timer and when the timer runs out switch to another background</li>
			<li>How to add a question page so when someone click on a certain sprite it will switch to that page.</li>
