					<h3>Python Content</h3>
					<h4>Unit 1</h4>
					<p> In unit 1 we started to learn how python worked and how to create print statements.
					We also learned more about how to use math in our coding.</p>
					<h5>Math.py</h5>
					<p> In this program we combined knowledge on input statements and math statements. Now
					we can ask for numbers from a person and then give them an answer. In the end we found
					the product and also the remainder.</p>

					<h4>Unit 2</h4>
					<p> In unit 2 we started to learn how to integrate if statements in python and continued to create harder and more complex code. 
					We also now know how to create def__init__ statements which starts off your code.</p>
					<h5>Line Runner</h5>
					<p>In line runner we created a game where a dude hops over a moving wall. An extra challenge was to add a moving reward and a 
					deduction to the game so that if the dude touched either of these extras it would add or subtract from the score. In the code when
					the dude jumps to a certain  height then it makes it harder for him to go any higher which prevents cheating.</p>

					<h4>Unit 3</h4>
					<p>In unit 3 the main focus that we had was learining about loops and how to integrate loops into our code so we can make cool games.
					loops allow us to repeat the same code over and over again insted of having to type out the code manually.
					<h5>Ground Runner</h5>
					<p>In ground runner we made a loop to place the background, which is grass, and randomly place the rocks as scenery all over the screen. 
					Then we had to create a score title and a timer. The goal of the game was to have your guy get all of the coins in a certin amount of time.
					If he got all the coins then the score and timer would read congrats! game win.

					<h4>Unit 4</h4>
					<p>In unit 4 we started to learn how to use lists. Lists help us group different sets of information so that it can be accessed by the code easier.
					For example if you have multiple outfits for a person, instead  of writing a different set of code to display every outfit, you can use a list to hold 
					all of the outfits and then use one block of code to display all of those outfits.
					<h5>Costume Runner</h5>
					<p>In costume  runner we used a list to hold multiple outfits for our person.  When we moved around the screen the guy now looks like he is facing
					the direction he is moving. This is all thanks to lists. We also had to start from scratch making our own person. What makes this a little bit harder is 
					that you can't use the same keys as before, so you have to remap the keys to move you new person around. Now you can move two people across the 
					screen and it looks like they are actually moving!</p>

					<h4>Final Project</h4>
					<h5>Lava Runner</h5>
					<p>In this game the main goal will be to get your guy across the screen to the other side. In your path you will have hot lava, where if you touch the lava
					you lose the game. In order to get across the screen you have to hop on the lava rocks that will be moving across the lava. Every time you hop on a rock the
					level will increase which means the remaining rocks will get faster and faster. </p>
